# Logic Auto-Encoder for Tic-Tac-Toe

Learning tic-tac-toe game dynamics using logic networks in an auto-encoder setting.

## Approach

Instead of reinforcement learning, this uses an auto-encoder to learn the game dynamics, which appears to be more efficient.

## Components

- `gym-tictactoe/`: Custom OpenAI Gym environment for tic-tac-toe
- `TTT_utils.py`: Utility functions for TTT
- `TTT_symmetries.py`: Board symmetry handling
- `TTT_optimal_rules.py`: Optimal play rules for evaluation
